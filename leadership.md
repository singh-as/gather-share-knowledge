Few agile metrics to measure team performance
1. Productivity - Cycle Time
2. Predictability - Say Vs Do ratio
3. Quality - # of incidents, PRBs, escaped defects
4. Stability - Is team happy with sprint execution



I believe there is no pre-defined recipe for building a successful team. It's an art to identify right people who fit well in the team culture, have skills and/or potential to perform the role and responsibilites. 

To build a successful team as a leader, we can create an environment of:
1. Trust
2. Collaboration
3. Empathy
4. Open communication
5. Equal say
6. Innovation
7. Acceptance of failure
8. Accountability
