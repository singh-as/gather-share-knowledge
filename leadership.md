Few agile metrics to measure team performance
1. Productivity - Cycle Time
2. Predictability - Say Vs Do ratio
3. Quality - # of incidents, PRBs, escaped defects
4. Stability - Is team happy with sprint execution


I believe there is no pre-defined recipe for building a successful team. It's an art to identify right person who fits in the team culture, has skills and/or potential to perform the role and responsibilites.
